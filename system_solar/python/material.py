    Material has no Shader/GPU knowledge. Each Shader owns the actual
    UniformBlock *and* tracks the last revision it uploaded (see
    Shader.add_material/bind_material) - two different shaders each get
    their own, independently validated, written, and revision-tracked,
    so the same Material instance can be used under more than one
    shader safely, and one shader rewriting its copy doesn't hide the
    update from another (a shared dirty flag would - whichever shader's
    bind_material ran first would consume it and clear_dirty() would
    leave every other shader's copy stale forever). Subclasses normally
    provide only semantic constructors and setters; the generic
    write_fields implementation handles the GPU-facing values. Values not
    declared by a particular shader are ignored, allowing one material to
    carry a superset used by several shaders."""
